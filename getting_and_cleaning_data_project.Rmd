## Review criteria
# The submitted data set is tidy.
# The Github repo contains the required scripts.
# GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
# The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
# The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.


##You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
# 
# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. DONE
# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. DONE
# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
